# üé£ Retrievall
Retrievall ("retrieve all") is a general framework for retrieval tasks. It aims to let you retrieve whatever you want from anything you want however you want to.

## Installation
Retrievall comes with a set of basic components and features. For leanness and extensibility, more specialized components are separated out into extension modules.

Retrievall can be installed from its GitHub source via pip
```
# In a dependency list
retrievall @ git+ssh://git@github.com/CohereHealth/retrievall-oss
# From the command line
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/CohereHealth/retrievall-oss

```


### Extension modules
Extension module dependencies can be installed using install [extra options](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/dependency-specifiers/#extras):
```
pip install retrievall-oss[sparsetext]

```

The built-in extension module components or functions are accessed as sub-modules of Retrievall, e.g.:
```python
from retrievall.sparsetext import Tfidf
```

The currently available extension modules are:
* `sparsetext`: Sparse text-based retrieval components, like `Tfidf`
* `ocr`: Representations of and interactions with OCR data, like Tesseract.

## Quickstart
> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a pre-1.0 version, so the public API may change rapidly.

Retrievall is all about retrieving pieces of information (`Chunks`) from a large collection of information or documents (a `Corpus`). The corpus, chunks, and retrieval methods are all user-configurable.

A corpus can be created manually, or helper methods may be used to construct one from existing data:
```python
from retrievall.ocr import corpus_from_tesseract_table

tesseract_ocr_table # pa.Table; Tesseract-style OCR data

corpus = corpus_from_tesseract_table(ocr_table, document_id="abc123")
```

Once a corpus is created, you can chunk, filter, and retrieve from it using any combination of components. The retrieval API is somewhat similar to [Polars'](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/getting-started/#expressions) or [Ibis'](https://ibis-project.org/tutorials/getting_started#chaining-it-all-together) chained expressions.

### Examples
```python
from retrievall.exprs import SimpleStringify
from retrievall.filters import Threshold

# Retrieve the text of the first 2 lines (a built-in chunk in this corpus)
# based on their `ordinal` value (a built-in attribute for line chunks)
(
    corpus.chunk("line")
    .filter(Threshold("ordinal", "<=", 2))
    .select(text=SimpleStringify())
) # `.select()` returns a pa.Table
```

```python
from retrievall.chunkers import FixedSizeChunk
from retrievall.exprs import SimpleStringify
from retrievall.sparsetext import Tfidf
from retrievall.filters import TopK

# Create rolling 64-token chunks from within pages, find
# their TF-IDF relevance score for a query, and select the 
# 3 chunks with the highest relevance score.
(
    corpus.chunk(
        FixedSizeChunk("page", 64, offset=-32)
    )
    .enrich(
        tfidf=Tfidf(
            SimpleStringify(),
            query="brown fox"
        )
    )
    .filter(TopK("tfidf", 3))
    .select(text=SimpleStringify())
)
```
